<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>Swimmer is the name given to a set of source code, technology and ideas whose
intended use is to simplify the development of client/server software for
handheld devices.
</p><p>Swimmer consists of:
<ul><li> The <i>Swimmer Client</i>, which is a thin, portable client program that runs on a handheld (or other) device and is capable of performing IO and running code in its virtual machine.
</li>
<li> The <i>Swimmer Protocol</i>, which defines how the server talks to the client.
</li>
<li> The <i>Swimmer Server API</i>, which is a set of classes and tools that simplifies the development of a Swimmer Server. 
</li></ul>

<h3>Download</h3>

Snaphots can be found <a href=/snapshots/>here.</a>
<p>
It contains sourcecode for the server and PC client and should build on Linux,
Windows (cygwin) and MacOSX.
<p>
The archive contains no mobile phone client, and allthough the client has
worked on Nintendo DS earlier, it does not run there currently (a new client that will
work on NDS and PSP is in the works).
<p>
You need boost,libpng & freetype2 to build the server and libsdl to build the client.
(Note that there is no cygwin package for SDL, you need to download and build it yourself).
