<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>Swimmer is the name given to a set of source code, technology and ideas whose
intended use is to simplify the development of client/server software for
handheld devices.
</p><p>Swimmer consists of:
</p>
<ul><li> The <i>Swimmer Client</i>, which is a thin, portable client program that runs on a handheld (or other) device and is capable of performing IO and running code in its virtual machine.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The <i>Swimmer Protocol</i>, which defines how the server talks to the client.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The <i>Swimmer Server API</i>, which is a set of classes and tools that simplifies the development of a Swimmer Server. 
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3> Background </h3>
<p>The initial reason for Swimmer's conception was the state of development for
mobile phones - I was hearing about developers having to deliver their code on 100-200
target devices, on how the limitations on Java/MIDP required all sorts of weird
tricks and how you needed to avoid using normal java constructs (ie classes) to gain
the necessary speed.
</p><p>It also grew from long time ideas I've had about making multiplayer/multiuser
applications much easier to implement through network-shared memory.
</p><p>I also wanted to do something with a very thin client and all complexity
moved to the server which makes more sense than the other way around (which
is the way traditional web browsers work).
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> Java vs Swimmer </h3>
<p>So why not just use Java? Why write a new virtual machine?
</p><p><i>Well;</i>
</p>
<dl><dd> A Java implementation with all classes requires lots of memory on the client even though most classes are never used (not really a big issue since memory is cheap).
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> The Java Virtual Machine is not very effecient, unless JIT-techniques or similar are used, which adds even more complexity to the client (also not a big issue since fast CPUs are available and optimizing the JVM is a well known problem).
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> The Java (and MIDP) implementation differs from phone to phone, so it is very hard to write a java program that works on all phones. This is a larger issue.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Java must work to be secure, since it allows access to the host hardware such as the filesystem etc. This limits features like dynamic downloading of code. This is a very important issue for the way Swimmer is designed to work.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>In comparison, the Swimmer Virtual Machine is:</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<dl><dt> Lightweight
</dt><dd> Will work in a very weak system, basically no lower memory requirement.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt> Fast
</dt><dd> The virtual machine has been designed to be as fast as possible - register based with no status register or flags, which means most opcodes are implemented with a single C-statement. This is particularly important since we want it to run well even if implemented in Java (VM inside a VM&nbsp;!).
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt> Simple
</dt><dd> As much complexity as is practical has been moved to the server side. Therefore porting a Swimmer Client should take no more than a day, and reimplementing it (in another language etc) no more than a week.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt> Closely defined
</dt><dd> This minimizes (or preferably completely removes) implementation differences - in the same way that a game written and tested in a Nintendo Gameboy emulator can be expected to run fine in all ports of that particular emulator, and most likely in other gameboy emulators as well.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt> Completely accessible from the Server
</dt><dd> The Server can directly access both data and program memory in the virtual machine. This is actually one of the vital differences, that makes Swimmer much more suitable for multiuser/multiplayer applications.
</dd></dl>

<h3> The Client </h3>
<p>The client was designed to be very easy to port or reimplement on practically
any type of hardware, but is primarily intended for devices with at least a
screen, a network connection and some sort of input mechanism (at least 4
directional keys and a button).
</p><p>The client also implements a set of <i>native functions</i> - functions for
rendering graphics on the screen or sorting/copying memory for instance -
that can be called either locally from Swimmer Machine Code, or directly
from the server (via a specific network command as defined by the <i>Swimmer</i>
Protocol<i>).</i>
</p><p>Normally a client connects to a server at startup, and then acts a slave (or
terminal), allowing the server full control - which means 'server' is really
a misnomer, but used anyway since it is such an established term.
</p><p>The server then feeds data directly to the clients memory, and connects
events to programs implemented in Swimmer Machine Code and located in
program memory.
</p><p>One way of looking at it is that the Swimmer Client emulates a simple,
made-up computer system, to which the server has full control.
</p>
<h3> The Server </h3>
<p>The <i>Swimmer Server</i> is not as closely defined as the client - as long
as it allows client connections and implements the <i>Swimmer Protocol</i> it
is considered a swimmer server - but usually you will use the <i>Swimmer Server API</i>
to implement your server, which is a set of classes that handles client
connections, shared memory, compilation of client programs, sending and
creating of (graphic) resources and a lot more.
</p><p>(It is however entierly feasible to write a swimmer server entirely from
scratch if you are creating some special, non-standard application).
</p><p>A typical server will wait for client connections, let the client report
its exact features (screen width &amp; height, available memory, available
keys, max packet size etc) and then send content (code, graphics etc)
that fits the particular client, and start execution on the client side.
</p><p>Shared memory is then used for easy communication - if for instance the server needs
to add a sprite to the list of sprites rendered by the client, it will
simply modify the list in server side memory, and it will be automatically
replicated to the affected clients.
</p>
<h3> Applications </h3>
<p>Swimmer was initially designed with handheld, multiplayer gaming in mind, but
is general enough for any client/server application, with clients of many
sorts; for instance a client that doesn't implement the VM and has no input capabilities
could still be used to present simple information.
</p><p>(Swimmer could theoretically even be used for distributed calculations, for clients with no
screen or input, but with a fast CPU and lots of memory).
</p><p>Here is a quick list of typical applications:
</p>
<ul><li> Massive Multiplayer Gaming
</li><li> Downloadable E-books
</li><li> Web browsing (similar to what Opera Mobile is doing)
</li><li> Information / Billboard TV system
</li><li> Shared productivity applications (eg a multiuser sketch program)
</li></ul>
